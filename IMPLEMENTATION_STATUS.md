# Implementation Status

Due to the comprehensive scope of this refactor, I'm implementing it in focused phases:

## Completed
- Analysis of current codebase
- Identification of all bugs and required changes

## In Progress
Starting systematic implementation with helper utilities first, then core refactoring.

## Implementation Order
1. Helper utilities (API wrapper with auth, ID generation)
2. Fix critical bugs (A)
3. Task model migration (B)
4. Security implementation (C)
5. UX improvements (D)
6. Translations (E)

The refactored code will be production-ready and maintain backward compatibility where possible.
